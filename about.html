      <h2> About Flashy </h2>
      <p>
      Flashy is targeted at students looking to make quick flash cards based on photos. The motivation behind the project was inspired by a lack of technology that exists to turn vocabulary lists in foreign languages into flash cards in a fast and efficient manner. Flashy can partitpion a page of vocabulary into flash cards and store them on the cloud to be loaded from a computer or mobile device. Flashy converts lists of structured text into flash cards as well as handle single entry inputs (such as a photo of the Mona Lisa with the ability to display information about it on the back).

      <p>
      Flash card makers do exist, and there are many of them, but there are none that we know of that allow for the making of flash cards based on photos. Some apps allow for single entry photo submissions but there are none that take lists of data, recognize and parse the data, and then builds the flash cards off of that. We hope to build a product that in the end will be able to convert lists of 60-70 words into a deck of properly formatted flash cards in a minute or two.
      Photos can be uploaded from a scanner, camera, mobile camera, or any other way that can connect the photo through our interfaces to our server.
